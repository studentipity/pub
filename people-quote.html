      var quotes = ["\u{201c}After dinner, I [...] thought over all the interviews, discussions and meetings that had taken place during the week. I asked myself:\nWhat mistakes did I make that time?\nWhat did I do that was right \u{2013} and in what way could I have improved my performance?\nWhat lessons can I learn from that experience?\nThis system of self-analysis, self-education, continued year after year, did more for me than any other one thing I have ever attempted.\u{201d}\n-Dale Carnegie\n","\nPeople do not want to be judged in any thought or opinion that they have or in any action that they take. Validation is taking the time to understand what their needs, wants, dreams and aspirations are.\n","\nStudies show people get more pleasure from talking about themselves than they do from food or money.\n","\nWant to correct someone? Want to one-up them with your clever little story? Don'Don't Contradict People.t do it.\n","\nDon't Contradict People. When people hear things that contradict their beliefs, the logical part of their mind shuts down and their brain prepares to fight.\n","\nAsk yourself, \"What idea or thought that they mentioned do I find fascinating and want to explore?\"\n","\nResearch shows just asking people to tell you more makes you more likable and gets them to want to help you.\n","\nListen to what they say. Don\u{2019}t interrupt or disagree. Don't evaluate. Repeat back the gist of what they just said, from their frame of reference.\n","\nIf you\u{2019}re trying to win over someone whose natural allegiances are not with you, getting into an argument is a sure way to fail. An argument is no longer an exercise in reasoning. It\u{2019}s just a fight.\n","\nBeing in a fight (aka argument) brings its own frame of mind, a whole set of attitudes, expectations, and conditioned reactions that go along with fighting (arguing). As soon as that happens, no one cares who is right and who is wrong. All that matters is who is friend and who is foe.\n","\nWe\u{2019}ve all been there: doing anything to win, it\u{2019}s messy, no progress is made or (god forbid) acknowledged. The only thing guaranteed is hurt feelings. Argument is failure.\n","\nNobody wants to admit they\u{2019}re wrong because it\u{2019}s now a status game \u{2014} and that\u{2019}s where \u{201c}winning\u{201d} comes from, it\u{2019}s a metaphoric struggle for life and death now and nobody wants to die. Argument is failure.\n","\nBut you still want to know how to win every argument? What happens if you bring video evidence, expert witnesses and logically back them into a corner from which the greatest trial lawyer could not escape?\nThey hate you. That\u{2019}s what happens. If you win an argument in absolute terms, they will hate you.\n","\n\"I want to prove them wrong\": And here\u{2019}s where you really get into trouble. You\u{2019}re saying you\u{2019}ll only be satisfied by an admission of error and that runs headlong into the brain shutdown and status game issues. Good luck in your personal war against biology and human nature. You cannot make someone admit defeat, but you can make them hate you.\n","\nA person\u{2019}s name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\n","\nOur patterns of anger are predictable. Surprise usually intensifies anger.\n","\nAnger is a normal emotion we all feel when we believe we or someone we care about has been wronged in some way. In other words, it\u{2019}s the emotion attached to injustice and unfairness.\n","\nWhen we put others down, we necessarily raise ourselves up in comparison. So, don't put down others.\n","\nNo matter how angry you are, there\u{2019}s usually some other emotions happening at the same time. And it\u{2019}s almost always a good idea to explore those other emotions rather than allowing the anger to dominate the whole of your emotional landscape. Often anger is a defense mechanism to distract us from other emotions.\n","\nSometimes, just a small decrease in how angry you feel makes all the difference.\n","\nFrustration is a milder form of anger.\nResentment is a much less intense form of anger, but the fact that it is long-lasting and \u{201c}sticky\u{201d} can make it quite impactful.\nRage is an extreme form of acute anger that\u{2019}s almost \u{201c}blinding\u{201d} in its intensity.\n","\nCognitive mediation is the notion that thinking mediates and affects the relationship between what we perceive and how we feel emotionally.\n","\nHow we habitually think determines how we habitually feel.\n","\nThis means if you\u{2019}re feeling angry it\u{2019}s because you\u{2019}re thinking angry. And the style of thinking that usually leads to anger is called rumination. Rumination is a style of thinking where we go over and over something bad that\u{2019}s happened in the past.\n","\nTry honestly to see things from the other person\u{2019}s point of view. Take the time to put yourself in the other person\u{2019}s shoes. If you can, sit down with a piece of paper and a pen. Set a timer for 10 minutes and begin with the words: \u{201c}What X is probably feeling now is\u{2026}\u{201d} Keep writing from their perspective until the timer goes off.\n","\nPeople are fascinating. Everybody has a secret world inside of them. Even the ones who seem lazy or stupid at first glance are awe-inspiringly capable. It is all deeply hidden in them. People can also be ridiculously insightful when you least expect it. People reveal different sides of themselves to varying degrees based on context. They all have something interesting to say, but they will say it only if the circumstances align for that, and the situation opens up and invites them to say it.\n","\nCognitive empathy is the ability to imagine things from the perspective of others.\n","\nEvery interaction with someone is an opportunity to peer into another life. A life you didn't live.\n","\nAn element of emotional intelligence is reading the signals people send and taking them into account.\n","\nAsk about another person: What is she dealing with that I don't see?\n","\nAvoid telling people about a similar experience you've had. You may think it will make them feel validated, but it usually makes them feel like you're not listening or like you're diminishing the significance of their experience.\n","\nWhen you try to solve a problem for somebody else, it sends a message to that person that you can't tolerate listening to them talking.\n","\nWhen you don\u{2019}t get along with someone, you are almost always choosing not to get along with them. You know exactly what to do to get along with them and don\u{2019}t want to do it.\n","\nTake personal appearance seriously, and view it as an ongoing project. So many people fall in to the trap of thinking they can avoid dealing with signaling, which is silly. You always are signaling so take a look at what you are sending out there.\n","\nIt is extremely normal to be rather abnormal.\n","\nMost of the intentions behind our actions are hidden. Most the time you feel something, nobody else knows about it. People tend to have stronger feelings about something than they let on. Loneliness is fairly common.\n","\nPeople disproportionately notice surprising events, become more swayed by surprising arguments and learn more from surprising information.\n","\nMuch of emotional intelligence comes down to social awareness; the ability to read other people, know what they're about, and understand what they're going through.\n","\nWithout being in a state of pain themselves, even physicians cannot fully realize what it's like to be in that state.\n","\nFind answers to these questions:\nWhat are my emotional strengths? What are my weaknesses?\nHow does my current mood affect my thoughts and decision making?\nWhat's going on under the surface that influences what others say or do?\n","\nIf our empathic accuracy and emotional regulation skills are strong we are more successful in our interactions. We possess the depth and awareness to predict the attitudes, expectations, and intentions of others that may be very different from our own.\n","\nWe are social chameleons, making slight shifts in our behavior to fit the people and personalities we are around, to relate to them.\n","\nPeople thirst for approval and dread condemnation.\n","\nWhen dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.\n","\nThe only way to get someone do to something is to make the person want to do it.\n","\nDelivering something a person wants is an effective strategy.\n","\nThe deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.\n","\nEach one of us spends an inordinate amount of time thinking about ourselves.\n","\nWe nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem?\n","\nMake an effort to identify and verbalize the good points in others.\n","\nThe only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.\n","\nIf there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person\u{2019}s point of view and see things from that person\u{2019}s angle as well as from your own.\n","\nThe world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition.\n","\nPeople are not interested in you... they are interested in themselves\u{2014}morning, noon and after dinner.\n","\nOne can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them.\n","\nGreet people with animation and enthusiasm.\n","\nThe expression on your face is more important than the clothes you wear on your back.\n","\nA smile communicates: \u{201c}I like you, You make me happy. I am glad to see you.\u{201d}\n","\nThe average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together. Remembering a person\u{2019}s name and using it in conversation is a powerful but subtle compliment. Most people don\u{2019}t remember names, for the simple reason that they don\u{2019}t take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds. They make excuses for themselves; they are too busy.\n","\nTechnique for remembering names:\n1) If you do not hear the name clearly, ask for it to be repeated.\n2) If the name is particularly challenging, ask for it to be spelled.\n3) Repeat the name several times during a conversation.\n","\nA person's name sets the individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others.\n","\nIn order to be a good conversationalist, you must be an attentive listener.\n","\nThe people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems.\n","\nThe royal road to a person\u{2019}s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.\n","\nThe deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.\n","\nAll the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you realize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.\n","\nThe only way to truly win an argument is to avoid it. Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.\n","\nYou can\u{2019}t win an argument. You can\u{2019}t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Keep away from arguments. Avoid.\n","\nA misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person\u{2019}s viewpoint.\n","\nSuggestions for keeping a disagreement from escalating:\nWelcome the disagreement.\nDistrust your first instinctive impression.\nControl your temper.\nListen first.\nLook for areas of agreement.\nBe honest.\nPromise to think over your opponent\u{2019}s ideas.\nThank your opponents for their interest.\nPostpone action to think through the problem.\n","\nShow respect for the other person\u{2019}s opinions. Never say, 'You\u{2019}re wrong.' Telling people they are wrong strikes a direct blow at their \"intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect.\u{201d}\n","\nPhrases like \u{201c}I might be wrong, but let\u{2019}s examine the facts\u{201d} is one way to diplomatically approach wrong ideas.\n","\nWhen we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our oesophagus.\n","\nLet the other person do a great deal of the talking. You talk less and listen more.\n","\nThe reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, puts himself below them; wishing to be before them, he puts himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.\n","\nThere is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason, and you have a key.\n","\nA phrase you can use to stop arguments: \"I don\u{2019}t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you, I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.\"\n","\nBe sympathetic. Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.\n","\nAll people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation. Appeal to the nobler motives. Make an appeal to the person\u{2019}s sense of honesty, fairness, integrity and sincerity. A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.\n","\nBegin with praise and honest appreciation. Beginning with praise is like the dentist who begins his work with Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling, but the Novocain is pain-killing.\n","\nTalk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.\n","\nAsk questions instead of giving direct orders.\n","\nWe ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person\u{2019}s pride. Whereas a few minutes\u{2019} thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person\u{2019}s attitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting.\n","\nI have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.\n","\nPraise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be 'hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.'\n","\nYou who are reading these lines possess powers of various sorts which you habitually fail to use; and one of these powers you are probably not using to the fullest extent is your magic ability to praise people and inspire them with a realization of their latent possibilities.\n","\nAbilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.\n","\nIf you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.\n","\nUse encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. The goal is to foster a desire to improve rather than foster a desire to quit. Emphasize the positive and be careful not to discourage through too much focus on mistakes and errors.\n","\nBe liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it \u{2013} and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.\n","\nWhen asking someone to perform a task that might seem undesirable, be sure to consider and articulate the benefits that align with the person\u{2019}s wants.\n","\nSix ideas of influence: Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, Consistency, Liking, Consensus.\nResponding to authority is a reflex, and we are often as vulnerable to the symbols of authority as we are to the substance. We see size and status as related. People with more prestigious titles are judged taller than those without, and taller people are seen as more authoritative.\n","\nWhen we ask someone to do us a favor, we will be more successful if we provide a reason. Regardless of the reason.\n","\nThe contrast principle states that if a second item is fairly different from the first, then we will tend to see it as more differently than it actually is. Therefore it is more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive item first; not doing so will actually cause the principle to work against them.\n","\nSix ideas of influence: Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, Consistency, Liking, Consensus.\nReciprocity: We are obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts and invitations. We even use \"much obliged\" as a synonym for \"thank you.\" Remember the hunter-gatherers.\nThis Rule Is Overpowering. Society dislikes those who don't conform to the reciprocity rule.\nAnother person can trigger a feeling of indebtedness by doing us an unwanted favor.\n","\nA consequence of the Reciprocity rule is an obligation to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.\n","\nA promoter who gives free samples can release the natural indebting force inherent in a gift while innocently appearing to have only the intention to inform. This is Reciprocity in action.\n","\nThe rejection-then-retreat technique is to ask a larger request that the other party will turn down, and then make the smaller request that you were interested in all along. The second request does not actually have to be a small request. It can be objectively large, as long as it is smaller than the first request. The contrast principle is also used here. The concession will also look like a smaller request than if one had just asked for it straight away.\n","\nA gifted negotiator takes an initial position that is exaggerated but not viewed as illegitimate, and allows for multiple reciprocal concessions that yield a desirable final offer.\nForging an arrangement through concessions is also satisfying. A party that is satisfied with an arrangement is more likely to be willing to agree to future such arrangements.\n","\nOnce we have made a decision, we will encounter personal or interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with it, and consequently respond in ways that justify it. Inconsistent people are seen as indecisive, confused, two-faced, or even mentally ill. Consistent people are seen as having personal and intellectual strength. Exploiters can structure their interactions with us so that our own need to be consistent with lead directly to their benefit.\n(Six ideas of influence: Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, Consistency, Liking, Consensus.)\n","\nOnce someone makes a commitment, or takes a stand or goes on record, then there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with that commitment.\n(Six ideas of influence: Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, Consistency, Liking, Consensus.)\n","\nMany salespeople use the \"foot-int-the-door\" technique, or obtain a large purchase by starting with a small one. The purpose of this small one is not profit, but commitment.\nMaking a small agreement can change our self-image, which increases our willingness to comply with larger requests that are only remotely connected to the small one. Once you have a man's self image where you want it, he should comply naturally with a whole range of requests that are consistent with his view of himself.\n(Six ideas of influence: Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, Consistency, Liking, Consensus.)\n","\nWhat those around us think is true is enormously important for what we ourselves think is true.\n","\nPublic commitments tend to be lasting commitments. And the more public the commitment, the more reluctant we will be to change it.\n(Six ideas of influence: Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, Consistency, Liking, Consensus.)\n","\nPersons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to attain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain the same thing with a minimum of effort.This applies to any effortful and troublesome initiation rite, where the loyalty and dedication of those who emerge will increase the chances of group cohesion and survival.\n","\nWritten commitments require more effort than verbal ones. And the more effort goes into a commitment, the greater its ability to influence the attitudes of the person who made it.\n","\nOnce we have made a commitment, we find new reasons that support or justify our commitment.\n","\nWe may experience true feelings about something a split second before we can intellectualize, or even rationalize, about it. This is the signal from our heart of hearts.\n(especially when you are being influenced by someone)\n","\nThe principle of social proof states that one means we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct. This applies especially to what constitutes correct behavior. We view behavior as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it.\n","\nWhen we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct. But others are probably examining the social evidence, too, leading to the phenomenon of \"pluralistic ignorance.\" which is the underlying cause of the bystander effect. Pluralistic ignorance is strongest when among strangers, because we like to look poised in public, and because we are unfamiliar with the reactions of those we don't know.\n","\nThe bystander effect happens because the personal responsibility of each individual is reduced, and pluralistic ignorance, where everyone else is looking around instead of taking action. The confusion, populousness, and low level of acquaintanceship in urban environments increase bystander effect.\n","\nWe like people who are similar to us in the area of opinions, personality traits, background, or lifestyle. As a rule, we prefer to say yes to the requests of someone whom we know and we like.\n","\nA halo effect is when one positive characteristic of a person dominates their perception by others. Physical attractiveness is often such a characteristic.\n","\nOur attitude toward something is influenced by the number of times we have been exposed to it in the past. Repeated contact with something doesn't necessarily cause greater liking. Exposure under conditions such as frustration, conflict, or competition leads to less liking.\n","\nWe dislike a person who brings us unpleasant information, even if that person did not cause the bad news. The principle of association also holds for positive connections.\n","\nPeople assume that we have the same personality traits as our friends.\n","\nIssac Asimov said that you root for your own sex, your own culture, your own locality. Whoever you root for represents you, and when he wins, you win.\n","\nIt is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority.\n","\nIn many situations where a legitimate authority has spoken, what would otherwise make sense is irrelevant. We stop considering the situation as a whole.\n","\nResponding to authority is a reflex, and we are often as vulnerable to the symbols of authority as we are to the substance.\n","\nWe see size and status as related. People with more prestigious titles are judged taller than those without, and taller people are seen as more authoritative.\n","\nWe respond with mechanical compliance to those who are in uniform, and to those who are well dressed. Trappings such as jewelry and cars also symbolize authority.\n","\nWhen confronted by an authority figure, ask if he or she is truly an expert. Focus on the authority's credentials and the relevance of those credentials to the topic at hand. Remember, responding to authority is a reflex.\n","\nWe rarely recognize the things that makes us want an item more (such as the scarcity principle), and so we begin to assign it positive qualities to justify the desire. When information is censored, we not only want to have it more, but we tend to believe in the information more, even though we haven't received it. Information may not have to be censored for us to value it more; it need only be scarce.\n","\nWe see a thing as more desirable when it has recently become less available than when it has been scarce all along. Not only do we want the same item more when it is scarce, we want it most when we are in competition for it. Such conditions have powerfully motivating properties.\n (scarcity principle)\n","\nThinking Fast and Slow says our emotional response to a suggestion or question informs and creates our logical answer. By affecting a counterpart's System 1 thinking, you can guide his System 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses.\n","\nEmotions and emotional intelligence must be central to an effective negotiation, and not things to overcome.\n","\nWhen you slow the process down, you also calm it down.\n","\nCharisma is the result of specific nonverbal behaviors, not an inherent quality. So its levels can fluctuate.\n","\nCharisma = having both power and warmth.\n","\nLower the intonation of your voice at the end of sentences, reduce how quickly and how often you nod, and pause for two full seconds before you speak. (charisma)\n","\nBeing present means having a moment-to-moment awareness of what's happening. It means paying attention to what's going on rather than being caught up in your own thoughts. When you're not present in an interaction, people will see it. Our body language sends a clear message.\n","\nThe next time you're in a conversation, bring yourself back to the present moment as often as you can by focusing your breath and then toes just for a second, and then back to focusing on the other person. Being charismatic depends upon being fully present in each conversation.\n","\nEvery time you bring yourself back to full presence in a conversation, you become more impactful, more memorable, and come across as more grounded.\n","\nWarmth is goodwill toward others. It tells us whether or not people will want to use their power in our favor. It's assessed almost entirely through direct body language and behavior.\n","\nFriendly body language leads others to assume good intentions, and confident posture leads others to assume we have something to be confident about. People accept whatever you project.\n","\nFor charisma, your body language matters far more than your words do. With the right body language, you can be charismatic without saying a word.\n","\nIf your internal state contradicts what you're aiming to portray, a microexpression will eventually flash across your face and betray that.\n","\nPeople can gain confidence from feeling that they look impressive.\n","\nCheck in with your face to note tension, in order to keep present. If something has created tension, release it.\n","\nUncertainty typically breeds anxiety, which impacts our internal state, lowering our presence and our confidence. To make uncertainty more comfortable, imagine transferring the responsibility of everything you're concerned about to a benevolent entity, such as God, Fate, or the Universe. Comparing and evaluating hinders our ability to be fully present. Notice when you're making comparisons or doing evaluations and use responsibility transfer.\n","\nOur brains are danger-focused. It filters for relevant information, but this can create an incomplete, distorted view of reality. It gives more importance to negative elements. It plays up negative elements and sometimes even omits positive elements entirely. To fix this problem, observe calmly that you'll survive even the worst-case scenario, and think of all the times you survived this feeling.\n","\nAsk yourself what mental state would be most useful in a situation, and rewrite reality to put you there. For serious situations, rewrite reality on paper, in the present tense. This accesses different parts of our brain and makes imagined stories feel more real.\n","\nDe-dramatize situations using the technique of rewriting reality.\n","\nTo be comfortable with discomfort, delve into its sensations. Feel their texture. Imagine yourself as a scientist investigating this experience. Give yourself encouragement, and remind yourself that it will pass.\n","\nBuild comfort with discomfort by breaking social customs: Hold eye contact longer, experiment with personal space, stand with your back to the elevator door, and strike up conversations with strangers.\n","\nDevelop and practice a go-to visualization to help you regain calm and confidence, so you don't have to come up with new imagery in times of stress. Also, just imagining a 20 second hug is enough to send oxytocin coursing through your veins.\n","\nGoodwill is simply wishing others well. One simple way to build goodwill toward a person is to find three things you like about him or her.\n","\nEmpathy means you understand how someone feels. Compassion is empathy plus goodwill, so you understand how they feel, and you wish them well.\n","\nTo build compassion toward someone, imagine their past and present, and put yourself in their shoes. If they died, imagine what words you could say about them, or even say to them.\n","\nSelf-compassion is the warmth we have for ourselves, and prevents internal criticism from taking over and playing across our face. This is important for emanating warmth.\n","\nSelf-compassion is the warmth we have for ourselves. Discover the ways in which you care for yourself, and to do these things when negativity hits.\n","\nWith metta, think of a time when you performed a good deed. Imagine a being who could have great affection for you. Feel them giving you complete forgiveness and wholehearted acceptance. With all your imperfections, you are perfect.\n","\nDisplaying confident body language will actually make you feel more confident; these feelings will in turn affect your body language, and create a virtuous cycle.\n","\nWhen you have presence, people feel that you are fully present and with them, listening to them, absorbing what they say, and understanding them. Kindness-charisma connects with people's hearts so they feel welcomed, cherished, and completely accepted.\n","\nWhen people have similar attires, demeanor, and speech, they automatically assume they share similar backgrounds, education, and even values.\n","\nTo break the ice, compliment something the person is wearing. Continue with positive open-ended questions: \"What's the story behind it?\", \"Where are you from?\", and \"What brought you here tonight?\" Use the bounce back technique to keep the spotlight on them: Answer the question with a fact, add a personal note, and then redirect the question to them.\n","\nDon't fret about what you said. What impacts people isn't the words or content used, but how they felt to be speaking with you.\n","\nWhen you listen, listen truthfully. If you\u{2019}re thinking about wht to say next, your lack of presence will be written all over your face. Master listeners never interrupt. They allow themselves to be interrupted, and pause two seconds before they answer.\n","\nWe associate feelings with sights, sounds, tastes, smells, places, and people. Others will associate with you the way you make them feel. If you are interested or even impressed with someone, they will associate all those positive feelings with you.\n","\nSpeak in images, and make them sensory-rich. Use the word you as often as possible, and create sensory-rich graphics.\n","\nAttention is a precious resource. When people read your writing or listen to you, deliver high value through entertainment, information, or good feelings.\n","\nAudience ratings for a lecture are more strongly influenced by delivery style than by content. Use your voice to communicate warmth and power. For power, speak slowly with frequent pauses, use a baritone voice, drop intonation, and breathe through your nose. For warmth, simply smile. Even thinking about smiling is enough to give your voice warmth.\n","\nWhen in agreement, nonverbal signals amplify verbal signals. When in conflict, we trust the nonverbal signal over the verbal signal. Imitating someone's body language, called mirroring, activates deep instincts of trust and liking. Be discrete: be selective, vary your amplitude, and lag behind your actions.\n","\nWe experience separation distress whenever someone maintaining significant eye contact with us turns away. To avoid this, keep eye contact for three seconds at the end of your interaction with someone.\n","\nTo have poise, avoid nodding more than once, excessive verbal reassurance, and restlessness or fidgeting.\n","\nBroadcasting too much power can appear arrogant or intimidating. Counter this with warmth-enhancing techniques, like keeping your eyes in soft focus.\n","\nReminding people that they chose you, your company, your service, or your suggestion is one of the best ways to maintain their support for you or your idea.\n","\nTo truly depersonalize criticism, don't mention their actions at all, and just explain what's going on for you: \"When I don't see a finished presentation until the last minute, I feel anxious.\"\n","\nAudiences remember beginnings and endings.\n","\nWhen speaking to an audience, avoid irritants. These are sounds or movements that do not add to your message. Every one of them is a form of communication that demands a portion of your audience's attention.\n","\nIn public speaking, adopt a wide stance, practice without a podium or lectern, and find the right volume to project confidence. Pause frequently and deliberately. Have the confidence to make your listeners wait for your words. Also pause for three seconds after you first walk on stage, while sweeping your eyes across the audience.\n","\nIf you make a mistake in public speaking, remember that entertainers do this to make themselves more relatable. De-stigmatize and de-dramatize.\n","\nIn public speaking, make a speech all about your audience. This takes the focus off yourself, lifts your self-consciousness, and puts you into a state of goodwill.\n","\nThe low-balling technique is a compliance method in which the persuader gets a person to commit to an offer they have no intention of keeping, and then the price is increased. A person who once committed, wants to continue that commitment.\nFor example, when buying a car the salesman agrees a price, but must check with his manager. While waiting you think you have secured a good deal. The salesman returns and says the manager would not agree and the price is raised. Most people agree to the higher price.\n","\n"];
