You worked all your life to be in a pressure-situation.\nYou can actually go all your life without ever getting into a pressure situation. Who wants that?\n","\nNo one can construct for you the bridge upon which precisely you must cross the stream of life, no one but yourself alone.\n","\nAll the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself.\n","\nGood writing is a matter of character. Instead of doing what is easy for you, do what is easy for your reader.\n","\nThe unselfish perspective: I'm not giving the presentation because I am important. I am giving it because you are important.\n","\nI am going to package the information so that it enters your heads as easily as possible.\n","\nDon't judge anyone's abhinaya, including your own.\nGood or bad = okay.\nNoticing errors = okay.\nNo more, no further.\n","\nYou are aware of a dramatic moment, but don't hang the whole piece on it. No need for dramatic underlining, or dramatic entries or dramatic exits. Let the piece be. No piece is particularly important, and no moment is all-important.\n","\nAny rule has benefits and drawbacks. Consider the drawbacks of the rule \"the audience must always see your eyes\". Don't follow any verbal rule too closely.\n","\nThe audience sees what I direct them to see. So, keep directing them.\n","\nBecome aware of every single movement of your eyes.\n","\nLook for opportunities in nritta to express longing.\n","\nChoodare -- because of that last charanam -- in a nindastuti.\n","\nSee priya akka's idai vida and then bragha's. It will be obvious that one is set and the other is improvised. Priya akka's abhinaya is surprising to the viewer because it is surprising to herself!\n","\nThat which you cannot yet feel, that which you cannot yet reveal to the audience -- is the measure of your art.\n","\nDo anything that will give you increased emotional range.\n","\nInfants are not qualified to talk. We develop by doing what we are not qualified to do.\n","\nWhen you closely observe a person\u{2019}s face, gestures, and tone of voice, your brain begins to align with theirs in a process called neural resonance, and that gives you a window into what they think and feel.\n...\nIf you want to increase your neural resonance skills, take a moment right now and practice. Turn your attention to someone who\u{2019}s talking near you, or watch a person being interviewed on TV. As they talk, imagine that you are that person. Visualize yourself in the position they describe and put in as much detail as you can as if you were actually there.\n","\nPeople\u{2019}s emotions have two levels: the \u{201c}presenting\u{201d} behavior is the part above the surface you can see and hear; beneath, the \u{201c}underlying\u{201d} feeling is what motivates the behavior.\n"];
