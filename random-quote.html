They are mental postures to be practiced till they become easy to do.\n","\nIt is always draining to engage in conflict.\n","\nLies are often much more plausible, more appealing to reason than reality, since the liar has the great advantage of knowing beforehand what the audience wishes or expects to hear.\n","\nModern technology offers endless opportunities to gawk at the wealth, status, and misbehavior of others. Be wary of this compulsive, pleasureless voyeurism. Keep your eyes on your own life.\n","\nChampions behave like champions before they are champions.\n","\nThere are hints in the data that grammatical features that speakers are consciously aware of tend to change more quickly, and features which are more abstract and less available to conscious reflection change more slowly.\n","\nThe biggest takeaway from these Kuleshov effect examples and definition is that you are always in control of the audience. The best filmmakers exploit that control, subvert that control, and respect that control.\u{a0}\n","\nAnyone can become angry \u{2014} that is easy. But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way \u{2014} that is not easy.\n","\nI was quite a jolly kid, but not particularly confident, and suddenly being someone else was amazing. And I could do things as someone else that I could never have done as myself.\n","\n\"Artist,\" \"writer\" \u{2014} how ostentatious these self-descriptive labels now appeared! These words indicate a function, not a status! They should be used as verbs rather than as nouns. For I am only an artist while I art\u{2014}that is paint, draw, carve... I was a doctor once \u{2014} when I still doctored.When I neither art, nor doctor, nor write... I just am.\n","\nPeople learn when they\u{2019}re surprised. Not when they read the right answer, or are told they\u{2019}re doing it wrong, but when their jaw hits the floor.\n","\nTeaism is the art of concealing beauty that you may discover it, of suggesting what you dare not reveal.\n","\nThe knowledge we get by tinkering, via trial and error, experience, and the workings of time, in other words, contact with the earth, is vastly superior to that obtained through reasoning, something self-serving institutions have been very busy hiding from us.\n","\nMaking the simple complicated is commonplace, making the complicated simple, awesomely simple, that\u{2019}s creativity. \u{2014}Charles Mingus\n","\nHe was like a spider sitting on its web, feeling the slightest vibration, knowing it so deeply as the world he had created and mastered.\n","\n\"Odissi comes from an era when people had more time, when you could live in a moment much longer,\" Ms. Sen explained. \"Finding that sense of longing, of yearning for something, takes time. You have to stay with it for a while, sit in it and experience all the colors of it.\"\n","\nThe ancient art of mathematics, Tao has discovered, does not reward speed so much as patience, cunning and, perhaps most surprising of all, the sort of gift for collaboration and improvisation that characterizes the best jazz musicians.\n","\nWhether its a 20 year old aircraft refueler, a marine officer, or the President - everything is so much better with a little care for others, people will go the extra mile to return the favor.\n","\n...the really significant education in thinking that we\u{2019}re supposed to get in a place like this isn\u{2019}t really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about.\n... learning how to think really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience.\n","\nBut religious dogmatists\u{2019} problem is exactly the same as the story\u{2019}s unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn\u{2019}t even know he\u{2019}s locked up.\n","\n...in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.\n","\n\"This is water.\"\n","\nIt is unimaginably hard to do this, to stay conscious and alive in the adult world day in and day out. Your education in this matter is the job of a lifetime.\n","\nImagine this: you can\u{2019}t draw very well, but even if you can draw very well, suppose you come in and you\u{2019}ve got to put together animation or drawings and show it to a world-class, famous animator. Well, you don\u{2019}t want to show something that is weak, or poor, so you want to hold off until you get it right. And the trick is to actually stop that behavior. We show it every day, when it\u{2019}s incomplete. If everybody does it, every day, then you get over the embarrassment. And when you get over the embarrassment, you\u{2019}re more creative. As I say, that\u{2019}s not obvious to people, but starting down that path helped everything we did.\n","\nOn music theory: It's like learning the grammatical rules behind a natural language. English isn't carved into a mountain somewhere, or programmed into our DNA, it's entirely made up by people, and you're free to break all the rules. But then you're unlikely to be understood. And if you are understood, we'll probably end up giving a name to whatever you did!\n...\nNot many people understand that hip hop, dubstep, deep house, death metal, jazz, and shoegaze all have unique theories of their own. They're defined by elements - some of which are simple cliches, and some of which are more creative - that make the style recognisable. If you know the elements and how to put them together, you know the style. Simple as.\n","\nIdeas don't need to be true to be helpful.\n","\nTo sum up, mental exercise is key, but only if it's not comfortable exercise. Learn a foreign language and start reading novels in that language -- it will be slow going and you'll have to look up many words; work your way through all of Shakespeare's plays, looking up all words you don't understand; teach yourself Calculus; teach yourself computer programming; etc. As soon as you master anything, take a day to celebrate and then move onto the next \"impossible\" task.\n\nDo something that takes time to complete, involves many difficult steps, and involves letting people down if you fail to complete it.\n\nPersonally, I direct plays, write books, and program computers. All of these are, in general, fun activities for me. But I do continually hit walls. But if I hit one when I'm, say, directing a play, I can't just say \"Fuck it\" and quit. I have to work through it. About 60% of time when I'm directing, writing or programming, I'm struggling really hard to overcome a problem.\n","\nMastery is shown by the lack of effort in that which is otherwise effortful. mastery is the invisibility of \"trying\" or \"achieving\", the invisibility of success and failure (or say, hitting the right beat). so mastery of aramandi is effortless aramandi.\n","\nSome motivation produces excellent performance; too much motivation produces choking. Some group collaboration produces cohesion and enhances productivity; too much of it leads to staleness. Some empathy enables you to understand what another person is going through; too much could prevent you from saying and doing hard things.\n","\nBeing able to think twenty years younger or older than your age is an incredible skill.\n","\nHannibal won Cannae by diligently setting himself up with every advantage well before the battle ever started. The Romans were exhausted and dehydrated by the time they even took to the field, thanks to Hannibal's successful harassment of Roman foraging and especially water gathering parties.\n","\nIn an interview several years later, Trump told me that he viewed the debate as an experiment in \u{201c}who likes pressure.\u{201d}\n","\nWords are mental models of the culture that speaks that language. Mental models are constructions that you like and don't question every time you employ. They are the meanings that are given to you.\n","\nPeople are a vestige, the tip of the iceberg, the poorly articulated expression of everything they are. (me)\n","\n\"I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you\u{2019}re the boss of the people who have only one skill.\" \u{2013} Scott Adams\n","\n\"The biggest mistake you can make is to accept the norms of your time.\" \u{2013} Neil Strauss\n","\n\"Where are you afraid of getting sprayed with water, even though it\u{2019}s never happened? Oftentimes, everything you want is a mere inch outside of your comfort zone. Test it.\"\n","\nNever go to sleep without a request to your subconscious.\n","\nThe Secret Question: Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don\u{2019}t see?\n","\nThe Distribution Question: Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?\n","\nAffirmations: \u{201c}All you do is you pick a goal and you write it down 15 times a day in some specific sentence form, like \u{2018}I, Scott Adams, will become an astronaut,\u{2019} for example. And you do that every day. Then it will seem as if the universe just starts spitting up opportunities.\u{201d}\n","\nAmateurs built the Ark, professionals built the Titanic.\n","\nEverybody should be quiet near a little stream, and listen.\n","\nHow much there is in the world I do not want.\n","\nremember when you wanted what you have now\n","\nKeep your eyes on your own life.\n","\nDon\u{2019}t underestimate what can be built in a year, or what can be destroyed in an afternoon.\n","\nThey\u{2019}d like to think for you and a part of you would like to let them.\n","\nSeemingly normal people can display extreme cruelty when given a socially acceptable scapegoat to vent their frustrations upon. Popular sadism is still sadism. Beware the dark passions of unthinking crowds. Guard your own moral standards.\n","\nBe something you love and understand.\n","\n\"I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be, whether we find them attractive company or not.\"\n- Joan Didion\n","\nThe truly precious resource is not your time, but attention. Spending attention wisely improves the quality of your time. Conversely, time is worthless when you attention is scattered.\n","\n\"Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.\"\n- Clay Shirky\n","\nA thing of beauty has both unity and variety.\n","\nThe best learners are the people who push through the discomfort of being objectively bad at something.\n","\nLike a man who seizes a wild dog by the ears,\n   so is anyone who walks by and meddles in someone else\u{2019}s argument.\n","\nNearly everyone acts according to their incentives nearly all of the time.\nNearly everyone thinks the incentives they operate under are virtuous.\nPeople who suspect they're beholden to bad incentives will deploy cognitive dissonance to avoid thinking or talking about them.\n","\nAll the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.\n","\nBeauty is the ultimate defense against complexity.\n","\nEven the strongest figures are fragile and want love, affirmation and affection. Idolizing people dehumanizes them.\n","\nI've been involved in devtools focused on making software easier to build for more than a decade now, and the best early predictor of success is the emergence of a professional hater class. It threatens their position as experts in arcane complexities, so they fear and loathe it.\n","\nBe humble for you are made of Earth.\nBe noble for you are made of stars.\n","\nMany musicians mistakenly confuse tension and intensity, tensing their muscles to try to create a big sound or the requisite emotion. This never works. They must learn to keep their bodies free of tension in order to freely produce the sound they want with whatever emotional intensity is required. The intensity is in the sound, not in the musician\u{2019}s body.\n","\nAn artist is one \"who produces or expresses what is beautiful, appealing, and of more than ordinary significance.\"\n","\nA person securely mapped as a musician in a world-wide community of musicians will talk to himself or herself with respect and compassion, with respect for the importance of the work and compassion for its difficulty. Supportive and encouraging self-talk will occur during practicing, but it will fall away for the most part during rehearsal and performance because it will have done its work in practicing. A musician securely mapped as a trombonist (or whatever, of course) will assume a status commensurate with that of the instrument. A musician with a deep regard for the trombone can thereby learn a deep regard for its player.\n","\nMusic itself is a musician\u{2019}s greatest resource in eliminating negative internal dialogue and in confining positive internal dialogue to those moments in practicing when it is useful. Resolutely turn your ears to the music and the music will draw your attention and hold your attention. Since music is a language of its own, it will gently push spoken language into the arenas proper to it and out of the mental territory ruled by music.\n","\nSymphony musicians are susceptible to ignoring the emotion and therefore practicing loses its appeal and becomes a miserable business of learning notes. This must be avoided.\n","\nI am old enough to remember when symphony musicians worked a sensible amount, with leisure to practice fully, to play chamber music, to enjoy their families, to care for their instruments, to cultivate friendships, to renew their spirits, so I know better than many current musicians how much they have lost.\n","\nMy observation is that those who learn the scores do so by constant attention to deep structure in the music, constant attention to the emotion of the music, constant attention to their own movement so that they can steadily push it toward as much efficiency, freedom and ease as possible. These musicians never just learn the score; they always have loftier goals, even under time pressure. They are always learning about the music, about emotion and meaning, about movement, and about themselves. These loftier goals feed the more mundane goal of getting the notes. Also, these musicians take frequent breaks, if only little ones. They give their brains genuine rest to assimilate what has been attended to. They also keep their own emotions vivid in their experience. They never waste any energy trying not to be frustrated or angry or annoyed or impatient or whatever they happen to feel at the moment. They never concentrate but always let their awareness play, hearing the birds sing, for instance, while they hear and feel their own practicing. Concentration is exhausting, but an inclusive awareness is constantly refreshed by its variety and fluidity.\n","\nIf the feeling that is keeping a musician locked into \u{201c}the office\u{201d} is disappointment in one\u{2019}s own performance, then the musician must express clearly what was disappointing and then resolutely address the inadequacies in practice so that real learning occurs. Then the past can be left in the past because the future is brighter.\n","\nI found the work to be so fully respectful of the individual. My being was never undermined. My personal truths and reality, albeit hidden to me in the beginning, was the focus of the work; it was a bit like stripping away layers to arrive at my own personal knowledge.\n","\nI believe that any teaching is ineffective unless it helps people feel, experience and become confident of their essential resourcefulness, their real self, their inborn freedom and security, their uniqueness and universality, from the inside of themselves and by themselves.\n","\nThe law of reversed effort: when you try to stay on the surface of water, you sink. When you try to sink, you float.\n","\nOnly doubtful truths need defense.\n","\nWe crave distraction -- a panorama of sights, sounds, thrills and titillations into which as much as possible must be crowded in the shortest possible time.\n","\nReligious ideas are like words -- of little use, and often misleading, unless you know the concrete realities to which they refer.\n","\nYou cannot capture running water in a bucket, for inside the bucket the water does not run. To \"have\" running water, you must let go of it and let it run.\n","\nYou will not see the sky through your glass window if you have covered the glass with blue paint.\n","\nThe legitimate use of (religious) images is to express the truth, not to possess it.\n","\nThe successful people in the world are the people that do the things that the unsuccessful ones won't.\n","\nNot far from where I live is a place called Death Valley. Death Valley is the hottest, driest place in America, and nothing grows there. Nothing grows there because it doesn\u{2019}t rain. Hence, Death Valley. In the winter of 2004, it rained in Death Valley. Seven inches of rain fell over a very short period. And in the spring of 2005, there was a phenomenon. The whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while. What it proved is this: that Death Valley isn\u{2019}t dead. It\u{2019}s dormant. Right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility waiting for the right conditions to come about, and with organic systems, if the conditions are right, life is inevitable. It happens all the time.\n","\nWhat these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong.\n","\nTo live the good life: We have the potential for it. If we can learn to be indifferent to what makes no difference.\n","\nShe is the best, most credible actress today. We believe her every movement and syllable she utters is totally of the character she portrays. With unrelenting devotion to her part, she never fails for a second.\n(on maggie smith)\n","\nWhatever purifies you is the right path. I will not try to define it.\n","\nYou would never say of him that he \"broke out a sweat\": but everything was allotted its own time and thought, as by a man of leisure - his way was unhurried, organized, vigorous, consistent in all.\n","\nsimple, not easy: losing weight is simple, but it's not easy\n","\nIf you are going to do it, do it right.\n","\nThere are some mental states that are conducive to the experience of well-being. And there are some which are adverse to it.\n","\nConsciousness is like a mirror that allows all images -- good, bad, ugly, beautiful -- to arise in it. But the mirror is not tainted, or modified by these images.\n","\nConsciousness is a cognitive quality. Consciousness is awareness.\n","\nMind training matters.\n","\nEngage the minds of others routinely. Don't treat them as mindless objects.\n","\nYou cannot get the truth by capturing it, only by it capturing you.\n","\nWhat art seeks to disturb is monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.\n","\nHow does a bee handle a flower? It extracts its sweetness, but does not damage it. Handle a book like that.\n","\nThe road up and the road down is one and the same.\n","\nYou don't have to be the happiest person to make someone else's day a little better.\n","\nThe problem was precision, perfection; the problem was digitization, which sucked the life out of everything that got smeared through its microscopic mesh. Film, photography, music.\n","\nEverything flows, and nothing abides. Everything gives way, and nothing stays fixed.\n","\nWhat we do in life ripples in eternity.\n","\nWhat is to give light must endure burning.\n","\nDon't bend. Don't water it down. Don't try to make it logical. Don't edit your soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly.\n","\nI'm at that stage of my life where I keep myself out of arguments. Even if you tell me 1 + 1 = 5, you are absolutely correct. Enjoy.\n","\nSpeak to people in a way that if they died tomorrow, you'd be satisfied with the last thing you said to them.\n","\nThose who do not have the power over the stories that dominate their lives, power to retell them, rethink them, deconstruct them, joke about them, and change them as times change, truly are powerless because they cannot think new thoughts.\n","\nWe look too much to museums. The sun coming up in the morning is enough.\n","\nWhere there is great love, there is often little display of it.\n","\nWhat can be explained\nis not poetry.\n","\nWe taste and feel and see the truth. We do not reason ourselves into it.\n","\nYour assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won't come in.\n","\nWhen we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago.\n","\nGo too far. That's where you will find the truth.\n","\nNothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future.\n","\nAfter all, you are just another me and I am just another you.\n","\nWhen you speak a word, it controls you. But when you withhold it, you control it.\n","\nA wise man once said nothing.\n","\nWhatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. Beauty is terror.\n","\nThis is the idea that we must destroy: that the knowledge of happiness is higher than happiness, that knowing the laws of humanity is higher than humanity.\n","\nWhen you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in. That's what the storm is all about.\n","\nDo not stay awake for things you wouldn't get up early for.\n","\nOnce we grasp the meaning of the conscious and the unconscious together, we become aware of the ancestral lives that have gone into the making of our own lives.\n","\nThe person most despised from among Allah's creatures is a man whose sharp tongue people are wary of.\n","\nHow much time one saves who does not look to see what their neighbour says or does or thinks.\n","\nIf you want the moon, do not hide at night.\nIf you want a rose, do not hide from the thorns.\nIf you want love, do not hide from yourself.\n","\n\"Where did you see god?\"\n\"Wherever I did not see myself.\"\n","\nCulture is perishing in overproduction, in an avalanche of words, in the madness of quantity.\n","\nALWAYS AVOID: short-term dopamine fixes.\n","\nTrust what you feel, not what you hear.\n","\nRules for happiness: something to love, something to do, something to hope for.\n","\nBe the captive of love so that you may be free: free from coldness and the worship of self.\n","\nI think he, better than anyone, understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.\n","\nLongterm thinking. Longterm problems. Longterm solutions.\n","\nTwo minutes of a high-power pose = more confidence (testosterone), less stress (cortisol).\n","\nTo forget one's purpose is the commonest form of stupidity.\n","\nStatus is a zero-sum game. Do not seek it.\n","\nAccept the hard truths quickly.\n","\nBe something you love and understand.\n","\nChoose the non-emotional response in every real-life situation.\n","\nDon't wage your own personal war against biology and human nature by engaging in arguments and god forbid, winning them. If you win an argument, the other person will hate you.\n","\nArgument = Failure.\nArguing with someone is a sure way to fail.\n","\nConflict is always draining. Avoid conflict.\n","\nConstantly scanning the world for the positive, allows us to experience happiness, gratitude, and optimism.\n","\nThere, but for the grace of God, go I.\n","\nWe don\u{2019}t have to earn the right to compassion; it is our birthright. We are human, and our ability to think and feel, combined with our desire to be happy rather than to suffer, warrants compassion for its own sake.\n","\nWhat is this self inside us, this silent observer,\nSevere and speechless critic, who can terrorize us\nAnd urge us on to futile activity\nAnd in the end, judge us still more severely\nFor the errors into which his own reproaches drove us?\n","\nOne's own self is well hidden from one's own self:\nOf all mines of treasure, one's own is the last to be dug up.\n","\nopen minds, tender hearts, relaxed limbs, soft faces\n","\nThere wouldn't be such a thing as counterfeit gold if there were no real gold somewhere.\n","\nSurvival is the second law of life. The first is that we are all one.\n","\nAll systems insulated from feedback from free markets or natural forces eventually get corrupted.\n","\nWe are poor judges of when we are learning well and when we\u{2019}re not.\n","\nInconsistent people are seen as indecisive, confused, two-faced, or even mentally ill. Consistent people are seen as having personal and intellectual strength.\n","\nIssac Asimov said that you root for your own sex, your own culture, your own locality. Whoever you root for represents you, and when he wins, you win.\n","\nThe Milgram experiments show that \"it is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority.\"\n","\n\"Why\" is always an accusation, in any language.\nInstead ask calibrated questions that start with the words \u{201c}How\u{201d} or \u{201c}What.\u{201d}\n","\nWe see the world not as it is, but as we are. When we describe the world, we describe ourselves, our perceptions, and our paradigms. The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, the more we can examine them, test them against reality, and listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a more objective view.\n","\nBe patient with yourself.
